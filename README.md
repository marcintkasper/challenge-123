# challenge-123

I create a static page every day for 123 days. 

<a href="marcintkasper.github.io/challenge-123">marcintkasper.github.io/challenge-123</a>

## Approach

1. Generate a theme using an online art theme generator.
2. Create a page around that theme. 
3. Aim for 1 hour of work on the page.
4. Publish the page.

## Goals

### Well Defined:

* Have 123 static pages

### Poorly Defined:

* Become a better developer
* Stop being a perfectionist
* Get into a work routine

## About this repository

This is a node environment created with yarn. I am using "yarn run" scripts to build the site structure on command (first time!). 

The `/src` folder contains the source code for the sites.

The `/docs` folder contains the resulting site for Github Pages.

The `/scripts` folder contains the yarn build script(s).
