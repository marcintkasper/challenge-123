# challenge-123

I create a static page every day for 123 days. 

## Approach

1. Generate a theme using an online art theme generator.
2. Create a page around that theme. 
3. Aim for 1 hour of work on the page.
4. Publish the page.

## Goals

### Well Defined:

* Have 123 static pages

### Poorly Defined:

* Become a better developer
* Stop being a perfectionist
* Get into a work routine
